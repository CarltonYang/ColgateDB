## Challenges and other noteworthy aspects

Throughout the semester, there were opportunities to go above and beyond the basic requirements.  Those opportunities include the following:  

- (Lab 4) Buffer Manager eviction policy (efficient LRU, clock, etc.).
- (Lab 6) B+Tree extensions: java generics, implement delete, support range queries.
- (Lab 7) Additional operators to support aggregration.
- (Lab 10) Deadlock detection using a "waits for" graph.	

In the space below, please indicate which of the above challenges you completed.  You may also use this space to draw my attention to any aspects of your code that are particularly noteworthy.  

Your response will guide my final code review.  (For example, if you tell me that you implemented deadlock detection using the "waits for" graph, then I will take a close look at that code.  If you think your LockManagerImpl.acquireLock is really elegant, let me know.)
