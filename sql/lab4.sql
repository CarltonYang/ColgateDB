-- For each of the queries below, put your SQL in the place indicated by the comment.  
-- Be sure to have all the requested columns in your answer, in the order they are 
-- listed in the question - and be sure to sort things where the question requires 
-- them to be sorted, and eliminate duplicates where the question requires that.   
-- I will grade the assignment by running the queries on a test database and 
-- eyeballing the SQL queries where necessary.  I won't grade on SQL style, but 
-- I also won't give partial credit for any individual question - so you should be 
-- confident that your query works. At the very least, your output should match 
-- the example output.
